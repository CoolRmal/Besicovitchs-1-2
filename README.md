# Besicovitch's 1/2-problem: a verified bound

A Lean 4 + Mathlib formalization of

$$
\sigma_1(H) \le \frac{6934}{10000} = 0.6934
\qquad\text{for every real Hilbert space } H,
$$

with no finite-dimensionality or separability assumption. This includes every Euclidean space,
and is accompanied by the planar lower bound

$$
\frac{1}{2} \le \sigma_1(\mathbb{R}^2) \le 0.6934 .
$$

The upper bound improves the published planar bound of 0.7 and applies in every real Hilbert space.
The lower bound is Besicovitch's classical one, formalized
here so that the planar threshold is pinned to an explicit interval rather than merely bounded
above. All proofs are complete: `Solution.lean` contains no `sorry`, and every compared theorem
depends on exactly the three axioms `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

📄 **[`paper/gram-certificate-bound.pdf`](paper/gram-certificate-bound.pdf)** — the proof of this
bound, and the argument for the choice of constant.
[`paper/six-point-constant.pdf`](paper/six-point-constant.pdf) is background: the six-point
analysis that produces the sharp constant $s_*$ discussed below.

## The problem

For a Borel set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with $\mathcal{H}^1(E) < \infty$, the **lower density**
at a point $x$ is

$$
\Theta^1_*(E,x) = \liminf_{r \downarrow 0} \frac{\mathcal{H}^1(E \cap B(x,r))}{2r},
$$

normalized by the diameter $2r$, so a straight segment has density $1$ at its interior points.
**Besicovitch's 1/2 conjecture** asserts:

> if $\mathcal{H}^1(E) < \infty$ and $\Theta^1_*(E,x) > 1/2$ for $\mathcal{H}^1$-almost every
> $x \in E$, then $E$ is countably 1-rectifiable.

Writing $\sigma_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for the *infimum* of the thresholds $\beta \ge 0$ such that
$\Theta^1_* \ge \beta$ almost everywhere forces countable 1-rectifiability, the conjecture is
$\sigma_1(\mathbb{R}^2) = 1/2$. It is an infimum, not a minimum: nothing here claims it is attained.

| **here** | $\mathbf{0.6934}$ | **this repository, machine-checked** |

De Lellis, Glaudo, Massaccesi and Vittone recast the question as a family of finite-dimensional
optimization problems: the passage from a density hypothesis to rectifiability routes through a
purely finite statement about disjoint balls centred at finitely many points. **The optimization
approach here is inspired by theirs.**

## What is compared

Five statements, all proved in `Solution.lean`:

- `sigma_one_le_6934_div_10000` — the upper bound of 0.6934 for **every real Hilbert space**,
  including infinite-dimensional and nonseparable ones.
- `forcesOneRectifiability_of_gt_6934_div_10000` — in every such $E$, every threshold strictly
  above $0.6934$ forces rectifiability: genuine admissible thresholds, so the bound on the infimum
  is not vacuous.
- `sigma_one_plane_le_6934_div_10000` and `forcesOneRectifiability_plane_of_gt` — the same two
  statements written out for the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$.
- `one_half_le_sigma_one_plane` — the lower bound. Together with the upper bound it pins
  $\sigma_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ to $[1/2, 0.6934]$; in particular the infimum is not the value Lean
  assigns to an empty set.

`sigmaOne` is an infimum, not a minimum: nothing here claims it is attained.

### Why the bound holds in every real Hilbert space

Nothing in the upper-bound argument is planar. The finite packing problem involves six points,
which always lie in a subspace of dimension at most five, and every certificate is a Gram-matrix
inequality: it holds for vectors in any real inner product space, with no coordinates anywhere.
The Besicovitch pair condition above 0.6934 is proved in every real inner product space, even
without completeness (`Besicovitch.besicovitchPairCondition_of_gt` in
`Besicovitch/Main/RationalBound.lean`). The final rectifiability argument now uses:

- the metric five-ball covering lemma to differentiate measures singular to a straight measure;
- compactness of closed convex hulls of compact sets in complete normed spaces, for continuum
  parametrization and surgery;
- separability of every finite-length set and its closed linear span, followed by isometric
  transport back to the ambient Hilbert space.

Completeness cannot simply be deleted with this repository's definition of rectifiability,
which uses curves defined on the whole real line. An incomplete inner-product space can contain
a relatively closed Bernstein subset of a smooth arc with density 1 that meets every global
Lipschitz curve in a null set. The mathematical construction (not itself formalized in Lean) is
documented in [the Hilbert-space extension note](effort/HILBERT_SPACE_PLAN.md).

## The lower bound

$\sigma_1(\mathbb{R}^2) \ge 1/2$ needs a set of finite positive length that is *not* countably
rectifiable yet has lower density at least $1/2$ almost everywhere. Besicovitch proposed one in
1938 and Dickinson proved its properties in 1939; the formalization follows Capdevila's 2026
account. The set is the graph over $[0,1]$ of

$$
g = \sum_{n \ge 1} f_n, \qquad f_n = \text{a square wave of period } 2 \cdot 2^{-n^2}
\text{ and amplitude } 2^{-n^2}/n .
$$

Two estimates carry everything: inside a level-$n$ cell $g$ varies by at most
$4 \cdot 2^{-(n+1)^2}/(n+1)$, and across a level-$n$ cell boundary it jumps by at least
$2^{-n^2}/n$. The Hausdorff measure of the graph over any set lies between the Lebesgue measure of
the base and twice it; the lower density is at least $1/2$ at every interior point because at
every scale the graph is a near-flat segment through the point extending at least the radius to
one side; and no Lipschitz curve meets the graph in positive measure, because a set on which $g$
is Lipschitz cannot straddle a jump — the Lebesgue density theorem then forces almost every such
point to stay clear of the grid on both sides at all fine levels, and the nested cell recursion,
driven by $\sum 1/n = \infty$, makes that set null.

The proof uses no projection theorem, no tangent theory and no area formula: it is elementary
throughout, which is what made it feasible to formalize. The modules live in
[`Besicovitch/Example/`](Besicovitch/Example/).

## Is it new? The literature search

Before describing $0.6934$ as new, we searched (on 2026-09-02) for any upper bound below $7/10$ on
$\sigma_1(\mathbb R^2)$ and for the value itself. Five passes were run: forward citations of De
Lellis–Glaudo–Massaccesi–Vittone (arXiv:2404.17536; Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 379 (2026) 5051-5098) in
Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, Crossref and zbMATH; arXiv listings and API sweeps of
math.CA, math.MG, math.AP, math.OC, math.FA, math.DG and math.PR through the September 2026
listings; MR Lookup, zbMATH Open, HAL, INSPIRE, Wikipedia, the Encyclopedia of Mathematics, GitHub
code search and the formal-conjectures corpus; the authors' arXiv, cvgmt, IAS and personal pages and
every located talk abstract from March 2024 to June 2025 plus the 2026 GMT Trento and Westlake
programmes; and an adversarial pass that read the published journal text of the paper, Schechter's
2002 UCL thesis, Farag's 2000 and 2002 papers, Bate's Acta paper, Azzam–Hyde and Capdevila's July
2026 preprint in full and re-ran the searches the first four passes had skipped. The paper has three
citing works in Google Scholar (Bate–Valentine, IMRN 2026; Capdevila, arXiv:2607.05206; Capdevila
Jove–Tolsa, Reports@SCM 2025), zero in Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex and Crossref, plus Bate
arXiv:2501.05920 found by full text; each restates $7/10$ as the best known upper bound or cites
without a number, and Capdevila (6 July 2026) is the latest to say so. The only numbers below 0.7
anywhere in the literature are the paper's own $0.683$ and $0.64368\ldots$, which its authors
present as a method limit and a conditional remark rather than as bounds; Farag's $1/2$ holds only
under a flatness hypothesis; Schechter's metric-space result is a lower bound. The value 0.6934
(also as 6934/10000, 0.69330, 0.693) occurs in none of the texts read, in the authors' companion
code (which fixes sigma = 0.7), in Google Scholar, in arXiv abstracts, in web search in English,
Italian, French, Chinese and Russian, or in public GitHub code. The verifier assigned about 95
percent confidence to $7/10$ being the published record and about 97 percent to 0.6934 being
unpublished. One correction: the published version credits the previous record to Schechter's 1998
Diplomarbeit ($0.72655\ldots$, reproved as its Theorem 3.3), between Preiss–Tišer's $0.73186\ldots$
and $7/10$; the table above now records it. Not reached: MathSciNet full search and Web of Science
(subscription), NASA ADS, the Semantic Scholar search endpoint, and the 1998 Diplomarbeit itself.
These are negative findings from indexed sources on one day; they could still be overturned by
unindexed, forthcoming or paywalled work, and novelty is asserted only on that basis. The full query
log is in formalization.yaml under review.notes.

## Why 0.6934 and not the sharp constant

This is the first question a reader should ask, so it is answered up front.

The finite problem this development solves — the **two-colour, six-centre** instance — has an
exact optimal constant,

$$
\theta_6 = s_* = 0.693306421825904872690678414403710951\ldots,
$$

an algebraic number pinned by an isolated pair of radical equations. The formalized bound is
$9.36 \times 10^{-5}$ above it. That gap is not a gap in the mathematics; it is the price of
making the certificates finite.

**Tightness destroys the certificates.** At $s_*$ the extremal configuration is *attained*: a
half-turn pair of chords at which three structurally different packing mechanisms tie
simultaneously. The weighted score that must be bounded above by zero therefore equals exactly
zero at an interior point, with vanishing gradient. A certificate for a non-strict bound at a
degenerate maximum has to resolve the geometry to the precision of the degeneracy. In practice
the margin away from the extremiser was about $10^{-8}$, and the adaptive subdivision needed near
the tie grew without bound — on one of the ten coordinate charts the score is identically zero at
the extremiser, so no strict certificate of the assumed shape exists there at all.

**Moving the chord breaks every tie at once.** With

$$
c = \frac{3467}{2500} = 1.3868, \qquad s = \frac{c}{2} = 0.6934,
$$

the three mechanisms no longer agree, the extremal configuration is infeasible, and the score
acquires a uniform negative margin of about $5.8 \times 10^{-4}$ — four orders of magnitude more
room. That is what lets a *small, fixed* family of thirty certificates replace an unbounded
adaptive search.

**The constant is also bounded from above.** The routing separators that prune the case tree are
themselves inequalities in the chord and fail once $c$ exceeds about $1.386850$. So the admissible
window is narrow: above $2s_*$ to break the tie, below that ceiling to keep the routing. The value
$6934/10000$ sits inside it.

A companion theorem, `sStar_le_6934_div_10000`, records that the exact endpoint does lie below the
rational target, so the two statements are consistent.

## How the proof works

The failure tree reduces the failure of all nine packings at a matched sibling endpoint to three
scalar slacks $q_1 \ge 0$, $q_2 > 0$, $q_3 > 0$. An algebraic identity says that for **any**
positive weights $\lambda, \mu$,

$$
q_1 + \lambda q_2 + \mu q_3 = \mathcal{W}_{c,\lambda,\mu}(e, p_1, p_2, w_1, w_2),
$$

so the weighted score is positive. The contradiction comes from bounding the same score *above*.
Because the identity holds for arbitrary weights, we take the small rationals

$$
\lambda = \frac{1}{12}, \qquad \mu = \frac{13}{14},
$$

which makes every downstream coefficient a small rational and removes the entire exact-endpoint
apparatus from the dependency path.

On a rectangle of second-child radii, six quadratic norm tangents, four radial secants and two
separation multipliers turn the score into a quadratic form in the five configuration vectors.
A rational $3 \times 5$ factor $F$, completed by elementary two-vector squares, dominates that
form:

$$
M = F^{\top} F + \sum_{i \lt j} \lvert \rho_{ij} \rvert
(e_i + \varepsilon_{ij} e_j)(e_i + \varepsilon_{ij} e_j)^{\top}
$$

is a sum of rank-one positive semidefinite matrices, so the Schur product theorem against the Gram
matrix of the five vectors cancels every inner product. What remains is a single exact rational
number $U$ per rectangle, and thirty rectangles cover every feasible pair of radii.

The binding certificate is on $[7/10, 3/4] \times [4/5, 9/10]$, with

$$
U = -\frac{141718938311359411043}{245112420775950000000000} = -0.000578179\ldots < -\frac{1}{2000}.
$$

## Where a computer is used

The certificate parameters were found by an unverified numerical search and stored as exact
rationals with denominator $10^4$. **Nothing about how they were found enters the proof.** Lean
recomputes every coefficient from the stored data by exact rational arithmetic and checks the sign
conditions and $U \le -1/2000$ for all thirty records. Positive semidefiniteness is a *theorem*
proved from the rank-one decomposition, not a numerical test — there is no eigenvalue computation
anywhere.

Hashes, program exit codes, floating-point samples, `native_decide`, `Lean.ofReduceBool`, and
unchecked external computations are not used as proof objects.

## Build

```sh
lake exe cache get
lake build Solution Challenge
```

Every push is also checked by the
[Lean Comparator](https://github.com/leanprover/comparator) in continuous integration: the
`comparator` job of the [Lean build workflow](../../actions/workflows/build.yml) builds the
challenge and the solution inside the real `landrun` sandbox on a fresh runner, checks that every
compared statement matches `Challenge.lean`, that only `propext`, `Quot.sound` and
`Classical.choice` are used, and replays the solution through the Lean kernel. The tools are pinned
to revisions matching Lean v4.32.0.

From a warm Mathlib cache this takes about **2.5 minutes wall / 12 CPU-minutes** in total. The
certificate-specific part is a small fraction of that:

| stage | cost |
|---|---|
| thirty certificate validity checks | 43 s |
| Gram certificate core | 7 s |
| band cover | 3 s |
| everything else (measure theory, routing, transfers) | remainder |

To check the result yourself:

```sh
echo 'import Solution
#print axioms Besicovitch.sigma_one_le_6934_div_10000' > /tmp/check.lean
lake env lean /tmp/check.lean
```

which prints

```
'Besicovitch.sigma_one_le_6934_div_10000' depends on axioms:
  [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

The project is pinned to Lean and Mathlib `v4.32.0`.

## Layout

| path | contents |
|---|---|
| `Challenge.lean` | the problem statements, self-contained, with the theorem holes |
| `Solution.lean` | the proved theorems |
| `Besicovitch/Statement.lean` | the same definitions, for the modular development |
| `Besicovitch/SixPoint/GramCertificateCore.lean` | the local certificate theorem |
| `Besicovitch/SixPoint/GramCertificateData.lean` | the thirty certificates and their checks |
| `Besicovitch/SixPoint/GramCertificateCover.lean` | the eight-band radius cover |
| `Besicovitch/SixPoint/GramWeightedBound.lean` | the coordinate-free weighted bound |
| `Besicovitch/Main/RationalBound.lean` | the bound in every real Hilbert space, without separability |
| `Besicovitch/Example/` | Besicovitch's set and the lower bound $1/2 \le \sigma_1$ |
| `comparator.json` | permits only `propext`, `Quot.sound`, `Classical.choice` |

`comparator.json` intentionally has no `definition_names` escape hatch: the definitions reachable
from the theorem statement are compared recursively.

An earlier form of this development pursued the sharp constant $s_*$ through six-variable
Bernstein certificates. That branch needed an estimated 29 CPU-hours of kernel reduction over 3072
adaptive leaves and was still incomplete — one of ten charts admitted no certificate tree. It was
removed once the Gram argument superseded it, and remains in the history at commit `7a8c833`.
